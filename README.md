Design Patterns Demonstration

This is a C# console application that demonstrates six different design patterns across Behavioral, Creational, and Structural categories.

Patterns Covered
Behavioral

Observer Pattern → Weather station notifying multiple apps.

Strategy Pattern → Payment system with multiple payment methods.

Creational

Singleton Pattern → Logger with a single instance.

Factory Pattern → Shape factory that creates Circle/Rectangle.

Structural

Adapter Pattern → Media player supporting MP3 and MP4.

Decorator Pattern → Coffee system with add-ons like Milk.

Features

Console-based, menu-driven interface.

Clean, modular project structure.

Easy to extend with more patterns.

Run Instructions

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/angelinjenifer26-art/DesignPatternsDemo.git


Open the solution in Visual Studio or VS Code.

Run the program and use the menu to select a design pattern.

Purpose

This project serves as a learning and demonstration tool to showcase practical examples of common design patterns.

Astronaut Daily Schedule Organizer

This is a C# console application that helps astronauts manage their daily tasks.
It uses design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer) to ensure clean, modular, and scalable code.

Features

Add a new task with description, start time, end time, and priority.

Remove an existing task.

View all tasks sorted by start time.

Mark tasks as completed.

Prevents overlapping/conflicting tasks.

Logging and error handling included.

Design Patterns Used

Singleton → ScheduleManager & Logger.

Factory → TaskFactory for creating tasks.

Observer → ConflictNotifier for detecting schedule conflicts.

Run Instructions

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AstronautScheduler.git
cd AstronautScheduler


Open in Visual Studio or VS Code.

Build and run the project.

Use the console menu to manage tasks.

Purpose

This project demonstrates how to build a simple CRUD console application while applying OOP principles and design patterns.
